Playbooks and scripts for ansible

This is where I store the playbooks I use at work. Feel free to use any that are applicable to your setup.

Everything hasn't been added yet, but should have all my playbooks up by this weekend!


Upcoming:  Web front end for end users to manage groups of servers via web forms/action buttons
